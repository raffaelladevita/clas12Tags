# clas12_tags 5.5

- added uRwell geometry and digitization 
- FADC time is double not int. Precision is 62.5ps
- target and beamline vacuum windows now native geant4 volumes
- fixed width of scattering chamber vacuum window and added beamline vacuum window
- added instrospection: -v, --v, -version, --version will show the version of gemc and the following:
- field persistence for 2 and 3d maps is float instead of double
- updated RICH hitprocess
- updated interface to FrequencySyncSignal to pass one of engine status longs as seed, to guarantee reproducibility of RFs
- added support for Full_transsolenoid_x161_y161_z321_March2021 binary map.
