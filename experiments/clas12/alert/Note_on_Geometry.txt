This geometry version is imported to GEMC directly from Coatjava geometry used for reconstruction!

AHDC ***************
from import org.jlab.geom.detector.alert.AHDC.*;
Inside factory_ahdc.groovy, the class is used
MYFactory_ALERTDCWire factory = new MYFactory_ALERTDCWire();
Detector ahdc = factory.createDetectorCLAS(cp);

geometry_java.pl is used to associate volumes, materials and sensitivity.
./ahdc.pl config.dat

Any geometrical change has to be implemented inside Coatjava package
/common-tools/clas-geometry/src/main/java/org/jlab/geom/detector/alert/AHDC/
MYFactory_ALERTDCWire.java

All AHDC is enclosed into mother volume (tube with a hole for target) ahdc_mother

1 AHDC cell = 2 sub-cells, 2 generic trapezoides.
Identifiers of each sub-cell = superlayer, layer, wire number.
sector is always =1.

2 sub-cells belonging to the same cell have exactly the same identifier!

superlayers numbering from #0 to #4
layers numbering from #0 to #1
cells numbering from #1 to #number_of_cells_in_superlayer





ATOF ***************
from import org.jlab.geom.detector.alert.ATOF.*;
Inside factory_atof.groovy, the class is used
MYFactory_ATOF_NewV2 factory = new MYFactory_ATOF_NewV2();
Detector atof = factory.createDetectorCLAS(cp);

geometry_java.pl is used to associate volumes, materials and sensitivity.
./atof.pl config.dat

Any geometrical change has to be implemented inside Coatjava package
/common-tools/clas-geometry/src/main/java/org/jlab/geom/detector/alert/ATOF/
MYFactory_ATOF_NewV2.java

All ATOF is enclosed into mother volume (tube with a hole for AHDC) atof_mother

Identifiers of each cell = sector, superlayer, layer, paddle.
Paddle is a regular trapezoide.

sectors numbering from #0 to #14
superlayers numbering from #0 to #1
layers numbering from #0 to #9
paddles numbering from #($sector*4+1) to #($sector*4+$npaddles)
$npaddle = 4
